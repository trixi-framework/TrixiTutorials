**Note: This repository is unfinished and deprecated!**

This repository was used as an experimental container while developing a tutorial 
section for [Trixi.jl](https://github.com/trixi-framework/Trixi.jl) with interactive
step-by-step explanations via [Binder](https://mybinder.org). The lessons learned
have been integrated into the main documentation of Trixi.jl. Thus, this repository
is not expected to be up-to-date and will not receive any updates.
