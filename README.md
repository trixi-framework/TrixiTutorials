**Note: This repository is unfinished and undergoing rapid and breaking changes!**

This repository will soon contain a tutorial section for [Trixi.jl](https://github.com/trixi-framework/Trixi.jl),
with interactive step-by-step explanations via [Binder](https://mybinder.org).
Since we will reset the repository history before the official start, please be aware of possible changes in the code and URLs.

We are working on it.
